#
#	Sample Makefile for COMP 421 Yalnix kernel and user programs.
#
#	The Yalnix kernel built will be named "yalnix".  *ALL* kernel
#	Makefiles for this lab must have a "yalnix" rule in them, and
#	must produce a kernel executable named "yalnix" -- we will run
#	your Makefile and will grade the resulting executable
#	named "yalnix".
#
#	Your project must be implemented using the C programming
#	language (e.g., not in C++ or other languages).
#

#
#	Define the list of everything to be made by this Makefile.
#	The list should include "yalnix" (the name of your kernel),
#	plus the list of user test programs you also want to be mae
#	by this Makefile.  For example, the definition below
#	specifies to make Yalnix test user programs test1, test2,
#	and test3.  You should modify this list to the list of your
#	own test programs.
#
#	For each user test program, the Makefile will make the
#	program out of a single correspondingly named sourc file.
#	For example, the Makefile will make test1 out of test1.c,
#	if you have a file named test1.c in this directory.
